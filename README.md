# PIDIR - A raspberry PI directory service

Tired of having to go hunt down your R-Pis ip addresses? Maybe you'd like to be able to keep track of all your Pis status? Maybe you'd like to make your Pis discoverable by other Pis on your network?

Well this will do it for you! It's pretty much Eureka for Raspberry Pis.

This is in it's initial state, more details coming soon once its fully built out and tested.
